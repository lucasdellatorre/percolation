// Percolation. We model the system as an n-by-n grid of sites. Each site is either blocked or open; open sites are initially empty. A full site is an open site that can be connected to an open site in the top row via a chain of neighboring (left, right, up, down) open sites. If there is a full site in the bottom row, then we say that the system percolates.
